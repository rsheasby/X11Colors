# X11Colors

List of X11 Colors for Love2D/Lua so that you don't have to type in/convert color codes manually. You can see a list of all the available colors here: https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_x11.asp

## Usage:
```lua
-- just import the library as a table
X11Colors = require 'x11colors'

-- and then consume the colors wherever you want
love.graphics.setcolor(X11Colors.chocolate)
```
